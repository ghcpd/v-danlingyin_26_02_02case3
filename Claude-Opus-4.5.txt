## Application Structure

| File | Purpose |

| styles.css | Complete responsive styling |
| app.js | All application logic |

## Features Implemented

### Core Functionality
- ✅ **Add, edit, and remove subscriptions** with full form validation
- ✅ **Billing cycles**: Monthly, Yearly, and Custom (n months)
- ✅ **Cost, start date, and optional end date** tracking
- ✅ **Active/inactive status** management

### Views

| Monthly | Direct cost | `cost` |
| Yearly | Divided by 12 | `cost / 12` |
| Custom | Divided by months | `cost / customMonths` |

### Renewal Date Calculation
The system calculates the next renewal by:
1. Taking the subscription start date
2. Adding billing cycle intervals until reaching a future date
3. Highlighting subscriptions renewing within 7 days with urgent styling

### Data Persistence
- Uses `localStorage` for persistent data
- Includes 10 mock subscriptions for demonstration
- All changes save automatically

### UI Features
