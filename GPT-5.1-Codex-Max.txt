You are a senior front-end engineer.
Your task is to design and implement a complete Subscription & Expense Tracker web application from scratch.

Application Description:
The application helps users track recurring subscriptions and fixed expenses, such as streaming services, software plans, or monthly bills.

Core Functional Requirements:
1. Users can:
   - Add, edit, and remove subscriptions
   - Define billing cycle (monthly, yearly, custom)
   - Specify cost, start date, and optional end date
2. The application must:
   - Show a list of active and inactive subscriptions
   - Calculate total monthly and yearly expenses
   - Highlight upcoming renewal dates
3. Users should be able to:
   - Filter subscriptions by status or category
   - View expense summaries

Required Screens:
- Subscription list / overview
- Subscription detail or edit page
- Expense summary view

Non-functional Requirements:
- No payment integration required
- Use mock or in-memory data
- UI should clearly communicate time-based costs

Technology:
- Any frontend framework or vanilla JavaScript is allowed.

Deliverables:
- Complete UI structure and navigation
- Data models for subscriptions and expense calculations
- UI logic for cost aggregation and renewal reminders
- Explanation of how recurring calculations are handled

Ran terminal command:  (nl -ba script.js | sed -n '1,260p'; nl -ba script.js | sed -n '260,520p'; echo '---'; nl -ba index.html)

- Built a desktop-first single-page UI with overview, summary, filters, and an edit drawer wired to in-memory data; navigation between overview/summary via tabs in index.html and interactive widgets in script.js.
- Implemented subscription data model, filtering, CRUD, and detail drawer: seed data, status/category/search filters, add/edit/delete actions, and category picker regeneration in script.js; drawer form and overlay in index.html.
- Added expense and renewal intelligence: active-state resolution, next-renewal stepping, monthly/yearly normalization, upcoming highlighting, and summary/category breakdown cards in script.js. Upcoming renewals within 14 days are visually flagged in the table and listed in the summary view.
- Crafted a bold, non-generic style system with gradients, cards, badges, and drawer layout in style.css.

**Recurring calculation logic**
- Cycle length in months is derived from billing type (1 for monthly, 12 for yearly, custom for N-month cycles) in script.js.
- Monthly normalization uses $monthly = cost / cycleMonths$ and yearly uses $yearly = monthly \\times 12$ in script.js.
- Next renewal walks forward from start date in cycle-sized month jumps and stops when past today or end date, ensuring inactive/expired items return null in script.js.

**How to use**
- Open index.html in a browser. Use the tabs for Overview vs. Expense Summary.
- Add/Edit via “Add Subscription” or row “Edit”; set custom cycles, dates, and status. Filters update the table and cards immediately.
- Upcoming renewals (next 14 days) are highlighted in the table and listed in the summary view; totals and breakdowns reflect only active items.
