Claude-Sonnet-4.5  :
User: prompt：
You are a senior front-end engineer.
Your task is to design and implement a complete Subscription & Expense Tracker web application from scratch.

Application Description:
The application helps users track recurring subscriptions and fixed expenses, such as streaming services, software plans, or monthly bills.

Core Functional Requirements:
1. Users can:
   - Add, edit, and remove subscriptions
   - Define billing cycle (monthly, yearly, custom)
   - Specify cost, start date, and optional end date
2. The application must:
   - Show a list of active and inactive subscriptions
   - Calculate total monthly and yearly expenses
   - Highlight upcoming renewal dates
3. Users should be able to:
   - Filter subscriptions by status or category
   - View expense summaries

Required Screens:
- Subscription list / overview
- Subscription detail or edit page
- Expense summary view

Non-functional Requirements:
- No payment integration required
- Use mock or in-memory data
- UI should clearly communicate time-based costs

Technology:
- Any frontend framework or vanilla JavaScript is allowed.

Deliverables:
- Complete UI structure and navigation
- Data models for subscriptions and expense calculations
- UI logic for cost aggregation and renewal reminders
- Explanation of how recurring calculations are handled


GitHub Copilot: I'll design and implement a complete Subscription & Expense Tracker web application using React with TypeScript for type safety and maintainability.

## 🚀 Getting Started

Run these commands to start the application:

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

Then open your browser to `http://localhost:5173`

## 🎯 Key Highlights

**Recurring Calculation Logic**: The app normalizes all billing cycles to monthly costs for accurate comparison. For example:
- Monthly ($15.99) → $15.99/month
- Yearly ($99.99) → $8.33/month  
- Custom 24 months ($120) → $5.00/month

**Renewal Tracking**: Automatically calculates next renewal dates by iterating from the start date through billing cycles until reaching a future date, accounting for end dates and inactive status.

**Real-time Updates**: All changes are immediately reflected across the UI and persisted to localStorage, with no backend required.

The application is production-ready with 8 sample subscriptions pre-loaded to demonstrate all features!
